# Hang Cheese

[My Notes](notes.md)

A brief description of the application here: This application will be a simplified version of the game hangman, presented through the lense of a mouse going after cheese. It will allow users to log in, play the game, and keep thrack of their's and other's best scores (in this case the lowest score).

You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wanted to play a game of hangman but lack the space to do it? This app will be the perfect thing for you! Enjoy a version of hangman that instead has a mouse going after a piece of cheese. Guess the word before the cheese gets got. This app will allow you to log into an account to save your scores, play a game of hangman with a 6 letter word, and compare your scores with friends and other users. 

### Design

Here is a sequence diagram that shows how player scores will interact with the backend in order to be viewed by others.

```

### Key features

- Secure login on HTTPS
- Randomly selected words for game
- Input of player guesses
- Updating graphic based on input
- Scores calculated and saved for other users to see

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses html to structure pages. Four html pages for login, play, scores and about the web application. Hyperlinks between each page.
- **CSS** - Styling of application that looks good on multiple web sizes. Good use of whitespace, color, contrast and updating images.
- **React** - Login, guess inputs, display of correct and incorrect guesses, and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Backend for:
    - login
    - random word generation
    - recieving and submitting guesses
    - submitting scores
- **DB/Login** - Store users and scores in database. Register and login users. Credientals stored in secure database and cannot play unless logged in.
- **WebSocket** - High score of each player updates for all others.
